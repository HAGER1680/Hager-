    Creates a dictionary of pet labels based upon the filenames of the image

    filenames and returns these label as petlabel_dic. This is used to check 
    the accuracy of the image classifier model.

     image_dir - The (full) path to the folder of images that are to be
                 classified by pretrained CNN models (string)
